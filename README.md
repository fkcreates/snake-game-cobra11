# java snake game

Snake game was a one-week project on the 3rd week in the OOP module in Codecool programming school.

The team has received a skeleton code with javaFX implemented, and we had to figure out the logic of our game, as well design the UI.

This is a two-player game.

### Navigation & Info:

#### Blue snake - Left: 'A', Right: 'D' 
#### Pink snake - Left: 'left arrow', Right: 'right arrow'

There are obstacles, health extras and fuel.

Bump icons decrease the health of the snake.
Health icons increase the health of the snake.
Some obstacles switch the direction of navigation for the other snake for a specific amount of time.
Other obstacles make the other snake stop.
Beware of the yellow heads, they are the police. These icons chase the snakes individually and once they get their heads, the snakes' health decreases drastically.

Enjoy the game!
